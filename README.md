Data Preparation

Action: Import the dataset into Power BI.

Action: Clean and transform the data using Power Query to ensure itâ€™s ready for analysis.

Segmenting Visuals

Action: Created visuals to segment sales data by country, region, and market. Used bar charts, pie charts, and maps. Used slicers to allow stakeholders to filter data by these segments.

Shipping Analysis

Action: Created a visual to show the percentage of shipping based on different ship modes. Used bar charts. Used DAX formulas to calculate the percentage of each ship mode.

Sales Analysis

Action: Created visuals to display sales data across different cities, states, regions, and markets. Used clustered barcharts. Used rill-down features to allow stakeholders to explore data at different levels of detail.

Creating Tables

Action: Created tables for each of the visualizations to provide detailed data views. Used matrix visuals to show hierarchical data (e.g., sales by region, then by state, then by city).

Interactive Report

Action: Used bookmarks and buttons to create an interactive navigation experience within the report. Added tooltips to provide additional context and information when users hover over data points.

Final Touches

Action: Ensured the report layout is clean and visually appealing. Tested the report to make sure all interactions and filters work as expected.

By following these steps,I have created a detailed and interactive sales report in Power BI that will provide valuable insights.
